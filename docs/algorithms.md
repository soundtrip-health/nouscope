## 1. Audio Frequency Analysis

**File:** `src/js/managers/AudioManager.js`

Three.js wraps the Web Audio API's `AnalyserNode`. The analyser runs an FFT of size 1024, yielding 512 frequency bins. Each bin covers `sampleRate / FFT_SIZE` Hz (typically `44100 / 1024 ≈ 43 Hz/bin`).

`getFrequencyData()` returns unsigned bytes (0–255), where 255 ≈ 0 dBFS. These are averaged over three fixed Hz ranges and normalized to 0–1:

| Band | Frequency range | Visual role |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| `low` | 10–250 Hz | Time speed, beat energy |
| `mid` | 250–2000 Hz | Turbulence (`offsetGain`) |
| `high` | 2000–20000 Hz | Displacement amplitude |

**Bin calculation** (computed fresh each frame from actual sample rate):
```js
binIndex = Math.floor(hz * bufferLength / audioContext.sampleRate)
```

**Normalization:**
```js
normalizeValue(value) { return value / 255 }
```

`AudioManager.update()` is called every animation frame; `frequencyData.low/mid/high` are updated in place.

## 2. BPM Detection & Beat Events

**File:** `src/js/managers/BPMManager.js`

BPM is detected once at startup by passing the fully decoded `AudioBuffer` to `web-audio-beat-detector`'s `guess()`. This runs offline (not in real time) and returns a single BPM estimate.

After detection, a `setInterval` fires a Three.js `'beat'` event at the detected interval:

```
interval = 60000 / bpm  (milliseconds)
```

Falls back to 120 BPM if `guess()` throws. The interval-based approach means beats stay locked to the initial estimate for the full track — there is no adaptive re-detection.

`getBPMDuration()` returns the interval in ms; `ReactiveParticles` uses it to set GSAP tween durations relative to musical tempo.

## 3. EEG Spectral Band Powers

**File:** `src/js/managers/EEGManager.js`, `_processEEGSample()` / `_computeBandPower()`

### Overview

Band power estimation follows a simplified fBOSC (frequency-specific Bayesian Oscillation-Suppression Criterion) approach (Seymour et al. 2022, *European Journal of Neuroscience*). The key improvement over a plain DFT is **aperiodic (1/f) background normalization**: each band's power is divided by the expected power under the fitted aperiodic model before the final relative normalization. This means a genuinely elevated oscillation (e.g. a strong alpha peak) contributes proportionally more than a band that simply happens to sit at a lower frequency in the 1/f slope.

### Stage 1 — Per-channel buffer management

muse-js delivers EEG samples via `zipSamples()`, synchronizing the four electrode channels (TP9, AF7, AF8, TP10) into aligned packets. Each channel is maintained in its own rolling 256-sample analysis buffer (`_chBuffers[4]`). NaN samples are replaced with 0. Spectral analysis is triggered every 128 new samples (~0.5 s at 256 Hz), giving 50% overlap between consecutive windows.

### Stage 2 — Per-channel spectral estimation

Band power is estimated differently for delta vs. all higher bands:

**Delta (1–4 Hz) — sparse Hann-windowed DFT:**
```
w[n] = 0.5 - 0.5·cos(2π·n / (N-1))          (Hann window)
DFT power at bin k = |Σ signal[n]·w[n]·e^(-j·2π·k·n/N)|²
delta = DFT[1] + DFT[2] + DFT[3]             (bins 1, 2, 3 Hz)
```
Twiddle factors (`w[n]·cos(…)`, `w[n]·sin(…)`) are precomputed at construction time, so the hot-path only performs multiply-accumulate operations.

**Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma — Morlet wavelet instantaneous power:**

The Morlet wavelet at frequency `f` (following BOSC_tf.m):
```
σ = τ / (2π·f)                    (temporal std dev; τ = wavenumber)
A = 1 / sqrt(σ·√π)                (amplitude normalization)
ψ(t) = A · exp(-t²/2σ²) · exp(i·2π·f·t)
```
Window: ±3σ samples (truncated from the ±3.6σ used in BOSC_tf to keep kernels within the 256-sample buffer). Theta uses a reduced wavenumber (τ=4 instead of 6) to keep the kernel short enough for a useful number of valid samples; the broader spectral smearing is acceptable for the wide 4–8 Hz band.

| Band  | τ  | Center freq | σ (s) | Kernel half-width (samples) | Valid samples |
|-------|----|-------------|-------|-----------------------------|---------------|
| theta | 4  | 6 Hz        | 0.106 | 82                          | 92            |
| alpha | 6  | 10 Hz       | 0.095 | 74                          | 108           |
| beta  | 6  | 20 Hz       | 0.048 | 37                          | 182           |
| gamma | 6  | 40 Hz       | 0.024 | 19                          | 218           |

Power is computed as the mean `|W(t)|²` over all valid (edge-free) samples in the window:
```
power_band = mean( re(t)² + im(t)² )   for t ∈ [halfWin … N-1-halfWin]
```

### Stage 3 — Quality-weighted channel aggregation

Each channel is assigned a weight based on its signal quality (updated ~4× per second):

| Quality | RMS (µV) | Base weight |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| good    | < 50     | 1.0         |
| marginal | 50–100  | `marginalChannelWeight` (default 0.5) |
| poor    | > 100    | 0.0         |

Up to 2 channels may be **dropped** (excluded entirely) based on `badChannelThreshold`:
- `'poor'` (default): only channels rated 'poor' are drop candidates
- `'marginal'`: channels rated 'poor' or 'marginal' are candidates

The worst-rated candidates are dropped first; at least 2 channels are always retained. Remaining channels are averaged using the quality weights, normalised to sum 1.

### Stage 4 — Aperiodic background model (BOSC_bgfit style)

Every `APERIODIC_UPDATE_INTERVAL = 10` windows (~5 s), the background model is refit from the quality-weighted average wavelet powers at 6, 10, 20, 40 Hz. A log-log OLS regression gives:

```
log₁₀(P_expected) = a + b · log₁₀(f)
```

The **first** refit uses instant adoption (`smooth = 1.0`) so the model immediately matches the actual signal scale rather than slowly converging from the dummy prior. Subsequent refits use EMA smoothing (`AP_SMOOTH = 0.3`) for stability. The initial model is `{a: 0, b: -1.5}` (generic 1/f^1.5 prior).

### Stage 5 — Aperiodic normalization → relative output

Each band's power is divided by the expected aperiodic power at its representative frequency. Only bands that are **actively mapped** to a visualizer parameter (via `ReactiveParticles.bioMapping`) participate in the normalisation sum; unmapped bands are zeroed out:

```
norm_band = raw_band / 10^(a + b · log₁₀(f_center))   [for active bands only]
norm_band = 0                                            [for inactive/unmapped bands]

Representative frequencies: delta→2 Hz, theta→6, alpha→10, beta→20, gamma→40
```

`ReactiveParticles` maintains `EEGManager.normalizeBands` (a `Set` of band name strings). It is initialised from the default `bioMapping` at GUI creation and updated whenever the user changes a Source dropdown. This prevents high-power but unmapped bands (most commonly delta, which tends to dominate the 1/f spectrum) from consuming a disproportionate share of the normalised total.

If all sources are set to `'none'`, `normalizeBands` falls back to the full set so output stays meaningful.

This preserves sustained brain-state information: a genuinely elevated oscillation (e.g. strong alpha during eyes-closed) receives a proportionally larger share after 1/f correction, and this persists for as long as the state holds — there is no adaptive baseline that would suppress sustained changes back to zero.

Before the model has converged (`AP_MIN_REFITS = 3` refits, ≈ 15 s), `bandPower` is held at zero to suppress spurious EEG influence during warm-up.

### Stage 6 — Temporal smoothing

Two layers of smoothing prevent the discrete ~2 Hz analysis windows from producing staircase jumps in the visualization:

1. **Source EMA** (`EEGManager`): After aperiodic normalization, each band is EMA-smoothed in place before storing to `bandPower`:
   ```
   bandPower[band] += BAND_SMOOTH * (result[band] - bandPower[band])
   ```
   `BAND_SMOOTH = 0.35` at ~2 Hz update rate gives a ~1.5 s settling time, matching the perceptual timescale of EEG state changes.

2. **Per-frame lerp** (`ReactiveParticles`): The viz maintains `_smoothedBands` and lerps toward the latest `bandPower` each frame:
   ```
   _smoothedBands[band] += EEG_LERP_RATE * (target - _smoothedBands[band])
   ```
   `EEG_LERP_RATE = 0.06` at 60 fps gives sub-frame interpolation between the discrete ~2 Hz updates, eliminating visual jerkiness.

3. **Display lerp** (`BioDataDisplay`): The band power plot maintains `_bandSmoothed[5]` and lerps toward `bandPower` each frame:
   ```
   _bandSmoothed[i] += BAND_LERP * (target[i] - _bandSmoothed[i])
   ```
   `BAND_LERP = 0.08` at 60 fps gives ~0.5 s to 90%, producing smooth curves in the EEG Bands panel instead of staircase jumps.

The three layers compose: the source EMA prevents wild jumps in the target, while the per-frame lerps smoothly track that target at display refresh rate for both the shader uniforms and the diagnostic plot.

## 4. PPG Heart Rate Detection

**File:** `src/js/managers/EEGManager.js`, `_processPPGSample()` / `_runMSPTD()` / `update()`

The Muse's infrared PPG sensor (channel 1) streams raw photodiode counts at 64 Hz. The pipeline converts these into a heart rate in BPM and a smooth 0–1 pulse oscillator using the **MSPTDfast v2** algorithm (port of `msptdpcref_beat_detector.m`).

### Stage 1 — IIR bandpass filter

Two cascaded first-order IIR filters isolate the cardiac band (30–210 BPM = 0.5–3.5 Hz):

**High-pass at 0.5 Hz** — removes slow DC drift and baseline wander:
```
α_HP = 1 / (1 + 2π·0.5/64) ≈ 0.953
hp[n] = α_HP · (hp[n-1] + raw[n] - raw[n-1])
```

**Low-pass at 3.5 Hz** — removes high-frequency motion artifacts:
```
α_LP = (2π·3.5/64) / (1 + 2π·3.5/64) ≈ 0.255
lp[n] = (1 - α_LP) · lp[n-1] + α_LP · hp[n]
```

Filtered samples accumulate in a rolling 6-second ring buffer (384 samples at 64 Hz). The MSPTDfast batch detector is re-run every `PPG_RUN_STEP = 64` new samples (~1 s).

### Stage 2 — MSPTDfast v2 batch peak detection

When triggered, the full 6-second buffer is processed in a batch:

**Downsample** — the buffer is decimated by `DS_FACTOR = 3` to ~21 Hz before scalogram analysis. The bandpass already prevents aliasing.

**Detrend** — a best-fit linear trend is subtracted from the downsampled signal (mirrors MATLAB `detrend`), removing any residual DC offset.

**Multi-scale Local Maxima Scalogram (LMS)** — for each scale `k = 1…λ_max`, a binary matrix `mMax[k][i]` is set to 1 if sample `i` is a local maximum at scale `k` (i.e. `x[i] > x[i-k]` and `x[i] > x[i+k]`). The maximum scale is capped to plausible heart rates (≥ `HR_MIN/60` Hz), excluding physiologically impossible slow periods.

**Optimal scale λ** — the scale with the highest row-sum (most detections) is selected as `λ_max`. This is the scale that best matches the dominant periodicity in the signal.

**Peak intersection** — columns where all rows `0…λ_max` agree (every scale marks a local maximum) are declared peaks. This intersection step is the key insight of MSPTD: only true cardiac peaks survive consistently across all scales, while noise peaks appear only at one or a few scales.

**Refine to original resolution** — each downsampled peak index is mapped back to the 64 Hz buffer (multiply by `DS_FACTOR`), then a local search within ±`REFINE_TOL = 4` samples finds the true maximum. A 300 ms refractory period (19 samples) is then enforced to eliminate duplicates.

### Stage 3 — IBI → heart rate

IBIs are computed from all consecutive peak pairs in the 6-second window:
```
IBI = (peaks[i] - peaks[i-1]) / 64
```

Only IBIs corresponding to 30–200 BPM are kept. The **median** IBI across all valid pairs is used (not the mean) for robustness against outliers:
```
heartRate = round(60 / median(ibis))
```

### Stage 4 — Heartbeat oscillator

`EEGManager.update(now)` is called every animation frame. It advances a phase variable at the current heart rate frequency:
```
heartPhase += (heartRate / 60) · 2π · dt
s = (sin(heartPhase) + 1) / 2          // 0–1 sine
heartPulse = s³                         // cubing sharpens the systolic peak
```

The cube transform produces a waveform that spikes sharply (simulating the fast systolic peak) and decays slowly (diastolic phase), matching the physiological shape of a PPG waveform.

## 5. IMU Head Pose Estimation

**File:** `src/js/managers/EEGManager.js`, `_processAccel()`

The Muse accelerometer delivers packets of 3 samples at ~52 Hz. Each packet is first averaged across its samples, then fed into an **exponential moving average** (EMA) with α=0.08:

```
smooth[n] = (1 - 0.08) · smooth[n-1] + 0.08 · raw[n]
```

The low α value (0.08) means the filter has a long time constant (~12 sample periods ≈ 0.23 s), passing only slow deliberate head movements and rejecting vibration and transient jerk.

Angles are derived from the gravity vector using standard tilt equations:
```
pitch = atan2(-ax, √(ay² + az²))   // forward/backward nod (rotation around X)
roll  = atan2(ay, az)               // left/right side tilt (rotation around Z)
```

Both are in radians. At rest (headset upright), pitch ≈ 0 and roll ≈ 0. The initial EMA state is `{ x:0, y:0, z:1 }` (gravity pointing down), so the filter converges to actual orientation within a second or two of connection.

---

## 6. Parameter Mapping — Biometrics → Shader Uniforms

**File:** `src/js/entities/ReactiveParticles.js`, `update()`

### Audio baseline (with per-band gain)

Each audio band has a gain slider (0–2). Mid and high default to 1.0 (= prior tuning); bass defaults to **0.5** for a calmer baseline animation speed.

```js
amplitude  = 0.8 + mapLinear(audio.high, 0, 0.6, -0.1, 0.2) * audioGains.high
           // ≈ 0.7–1.0 baseline driven by high-frequency energy
offsetGain = audio.mid * 0.6 * audioGains.mid
           // 0–0.6 baseline driven by mid-frequency energy
size        = BASE_SIZE  (1.1)   // audio has no size baseline
maxDistance = BASE_MAX_DISTANCE  (1.8)  // audio has no maxDistance baseline
```

`time` is incremented each frame at a rate driven by `audio.low`:
```js
t = mapLinear(audio.low, 0.6, 1.0, 0.2, 0.5)
time += max(0.01, clamp(t, 0.2, 0.5) * audioGains.bass)
```
Higher bass → faster overall animation speed. Floor of 0.01 keeps animation ticking at low gain.

### Bio mapping (user-configurable)

Each viz parameter has an independently configurable bio source and weight. Most parameters use **multiplicative** scaling so that EEG modulates the audio reactivity rather than simply adding a small offset:

```js
sources = { none:0, delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma, hr: heartPulse }

// Multiplicative — EEG scales the audio-driven baseline
amplitude  *= (1 + sources[mapping.amplitude.source]  * mapping.amplitude.weight)
offsetGain *= (1 + sources[mapping.offsetGain.source] * mapping.offsetGain.weight)
size       *= (1 + sources[mapping.size.source]       * mapping.size.weight)
maxDistance *= (1 + sources[mapping.maxDistance.source] * mapping.maxDistance.weight)
frequency   = baseFrequency * (1 + sources[mapping.frequency.source] * mapping.frequency.weight)

// Direct assignment (no audio baseline to multiply)
hueShift_uniform   = sources[mapping.hueShift.source]   * mapping.hueShift.weight
heartPulse_uniform = sources[mapping.heartPulse.source] * mapping.heartPulse.weight
```

A focused brain (high gamma/beta) amplifies the music's visual effect; a calm brain softens it. At rest (EEG sources = 0), the multiplier is 1.0 and behavior matches audio-only mode.

**Default mapping:**

| Viz parameter | Default source | Weight range | Default weight | Scaling | Notes |
|---------------|---------------|--------------|----------------|---------|-------|
| Amplitude     | gamma         | 0.0 – 1.0   | 0.5            | ×(1+s·w) | Focus → 50% more displacement at full gamma |
| Turbulence    | beta          | 0.0 – 2.0   | 1.0            | ×(1+s·w) | Alert → doubled turbulence |
| Particle Size | theta         | 0.0 – 3.0   | 1.5            | ×(1+s·w) | Drowsy → 2.5× larger particles |
| Spread Radius | alpha         | 0.0 – 2.0   | 1.0            | ×(1+s·w) | Calm → doubled spread |
| Field Chaos   | beta          | 0.0 – 3.0   | 1.5            | ×(1+s·w) | Alert → 2.5× curl frequency (tighter vortices) |
| Hue Shift     | gamma         | 0.0 – 0.25  | 0.12           | direct  | Focus → ~43° hue rotation at full gamma |
| Color Flush   | hr            | 0.0 – 2.0   | 1.0            | direct  | Heart rate → warm reddish pulse |

Weight slider: `min` = no contribution, `max` = full effect. Any source can be routed to any parameter — e.g. mapping `hr` to `amplitude` makes particles pulse with each heartbeat, or mapping `alpha` to `heartPulse` flushes color with calm mental states. `delta` is available as a source but has no default mapping.

### IMU head control

When `headControl` is enabled:
```js
holderObjects.rotation.x = headPose.pitch * imuStrength * 0.8
holderObjects.rotation.y = headPose.roll  * imuStrength * 0.8
```
Any active GSAP rotation tweens are killed immediately. Disabling head control triggers a 1.5 s ease-out tween back to zero rotation. `imuStrength` is a 0–3 slider in the VISUALIZER GUI folder.

---

## 7. Vertex Shader — Curl Noise Displacement

**File:** `src/js/entities/glsl/vertex.glsl`

The shader runs once per particle (vertex). It displaces each particle away from its base geometry position using a **curl noise** field — a divergence-free vector field derived from 2D simplex noise. Divergence-free means the flow has no sources or sinks: particles circulate without clumping or voids.

### Curl computation

The curl of a scalar noise field `n(x,y)` is approximated by finite differences over three axis-pairs:

```glsl
// Example for curl.x (simplified):
a = (noise(x, y+ε) - noise(x, y-ε)) / 2ε
b = (noise(x, z+ε) - noise(x, z-ε)) / 2ε
curl.x = a - b
// similarly for curl.y and curl.z
```

The noise field is scrolled through time:
```glsl
x += time * 0.05;  y += time * 0.05;  z += time * 0.05;
```
This animates the flow continuously. `frequency` scales the input coordinates, controlling how tightly coiled the flow is (higher → smaller vortices).

### Displacement and blending

```glsl
vec3 target = position + (normal * 0.1) + curl(...) * amplitude;
float d = length(position - target) / maxDistance;
newpos = mix(position, target, pow(d, 4.0));
```

The `pow(d, 4.0)` falloff keeps particles near the surface when displacement is small — only strongly displaced particles move far — creating a "melting" effect that respects the geometry shape at low amplitude and explodes outward at high amplitude.

`maxDistance` scales the normalized displacement `d`. A higher `maxDistance` (e.g. from high alpha power) means a given curl magnitude produces a smaller `d`, keeping particles closer to the surface.

### Extra turbulence

```glsl
newpos.z += sin(time) * (0.1 * offsetGain);
```

A simple sinusoidal z-oscillation adds a secondary "breathing" motion driven by mid-frequency audio. This is intentionally simple — it breaks the spatial coherence of the curl field and adds perceptual complexity.

### Point sizing

```glsl
gl_PointSize = size + (pow(d, 3.0) * offsetSize) * (1.0 / -mvPosition.z);
```

- Base size from `size` uniform (EEG theta-modulated)
- Displaced particles are rendered larger: `pow(d, 3.0) * offsetSize`
- Divided by depth (`-mvPosition.z`) gives perspective-correct shrinking with distance
- `offsetSize` is randomized per geometry (30–60) to vary the visual density

The varying `vDistance` (= `d`) is passed to the fragment shader for color mapping.

---

## 8. Fragment Shader — Color & Heartbeat Flush

**File:** `src/js/entities/glsl/fragment.glsl`

### Circular point mask

WebGL renders each point as a quad. The fragment shader converts it to a soft-edged circle using `gl_PointCoord` (0–1 UV within the quad):

```glsl
vec2 dist = uv - vec2(0.5);
circle = 1.0 - smoothstep(r - r*0.01, r + r*0.01, dot(dist, dist) * 4.0);
```

`dot(dist,dist)*4.0` is equivalent to `(2·|dist|)²`, mapping the unit circle to 0 at center and 1 at the quad edge. The `smoothstep` gives a 1% soft edge.

### Distance-based color gradient

```glsl
vec3 color = mix(startColor, endColor, vDistance);
```

`vDistance` is the normalized displacement magnitude from the vertex shader. Particles near their base geometry position (low displacement) receive `startColor`; maximally displaced particles receive `endColor`. This means the gradient directly encodes how much the particle is being pushed by the curl field at this moment.

### EEG hue shift

```glsl
vec3 hsv = rgb2hsv(color);
hsv.x = fract(hsv.x + hueShift);
color = hsv2rgb(hsv);
```

The `hueShift` uniform (driven by gamma by default) rotates the entire color palette through HSV hue space. At rest (hueShift = 0), colors are unchanged. At full gamma with default weight (0.12), the palette rotates ~43° — a clearly visible shift toward warmer or cooler tones depending on the user's chosen start/end colors. The `fract()` wraps the hue angle so all values produce valid colors. RGB↔HSV conversion uses the standard Hue-Saturation-Value formulation.

### Heartbeat warm flush

```glsl
vec3 pulseWarm = vec3(0.45, 0.05, 0.08);   // reddish-warm additive color
color = mix(color, color + pulseWarm, heartPulse * 0.35);
```

At `heartPulse = 1.0` (peak systole), the color shifts by `0.35 × pulseWarm` — a warm reddish-orange tint that fades smoothly as the oscillator decays. The additive formulation means the color shift is always in the warm direction regardless of the current `startColor/endColor` setting.

### Alpha

```glsl
gl_FragColor = vec4(color, circle.r * vDistance);
```

Particles are transparent near the base geometry surface (`vDistance ≈ 0`) and fully opaque when maximally displaced. Combined with the circular mask, this means only strongly displaced particles are visible, and they fade at the center of each point.

## 9. Beat Reactions — Geometry & Rotation

**File:** `src/js/entities/ReactiveParticles.js`, `onBPMBeat()` / `resetMesh()`

On each beat event from `BPMManager`:

```
30% chance → GSAP rotation tween on holderObjects.rotation.z
               (skipped when headControl is active)
30% chance → geometry reset (destroyMesh → createCylinderMesh)
```

Geometry reset also triggers a GSAP tween on the base curl-field frequency:
```js
gsap.to(this, {
  duration: bpmDuration * 2,
  _baseFrequency: randFloat(0.5, 3),
  ease: 'expo.easeInOut',
})
```

The actual `frequency` uniform is set each frame as `_baseFrequency * (1 + eegSource * weight)`, so EEG modulates whatever frequency the beat tween is currently interpolating toward. This gradually shifts the curl field density over two beats, producing smooth visual transitions between coarse and fine-grained flow — with EEG adding a real-time layer of chaos on top.

**Rotation tween duration** is randomly either:
- `15 s` (80% chance) — slow drift, crosses multiple beats
- `bpmDuration` (20% chance) — snaps to a new angle in exactly one beat

**Geometry disposal:** `destroyMesh()` calls `geometry.dispose()` and `material.dispose()` to free GPU buffers, and kills any active GSAP tweens on the old mesh before removal. New geometry shares the same `ShaderMaterial` instance.

Both box and cylinder geometries randomize their segment counts on each creation, producing varied point densities and visual textures without any additional code.

## 10. EEG Spectrogram Display

**Files:** `src/js/managers/EEGManager.js` (`_computeSpectrum()`, `_computeSpectrumLo()`), `src/js/ui/BioDataDisplay.js` (`_updateSpectrum()`, `_updateSpectrumLo()`)

### Overview

A scrolling time–frequency heatmap of EEG power, computed alongside the band power pipeline (Section 3). Each column represents one 256-sample analysis window (~0.5 s at 256 Hz, 50% overlap), covering 1–50 Hz at 1 Hz resolution. The display uses a viridis colormap on log₁₀-scaled power with auto-ranging. A second hi-resolution panel covers 0.5–8.0 Hz at 0.1 Hz resolution (using a separate 2560-sample / 10 s window) to reveal sub-Hz beat entrainment and delta/theta dynamics.

### Stage 1 — Hann-windowed DFT (bins 1–50)

The same precomputed Hann-weighted twiddle factors used for delta band power (Section 3, Stage 2) are extended to cover all 50 bins:

```
w[n] = 0.5 - 0.5·cos(2π·n / (N-1))          (Hann window, N=256)
power[k] = |Σ sig[n]·w[n]·e^(-j·2π·k·n/N)|²   for k = 1…50
```

Twiddle factors (`w[n]·cos(…)`, `w[n]·sin(…)`) for all 50 bins are precomputed at construction time alongside the wavelet kernels, so the hot-path performs only multiply-accumulate operations.

### Stage 2 — Quality-weighted channel average

Per-bin power is averaged across EEG channels using the same quality weights as band power (Section 3, Stage 3). Dropped channels (weight = 0) are skipped entirely.

### Stage 3 — Artifact rejection

Each retained channel's 256-sample buffer is scanned for samples exceeding ±150 µV. If more than 10% of samples on any single retained channel exceed this threshold, the entire window is rejected and no spectrogram column is emitted. The percentage-based approach prevents occasional blink spikes from blanking the spectrogram while still rejecting windows dominated by sustained movement artifacts.

Rejected windows simply hold the previous column on-screen (the display does not advance), producing a momentary pause in the scrolling heatmap rather than a visible artifact stripe.

### Stage 4 — Log power & display buffer

Power values are stored as `log₁₀(power + 1e-10)` in a rolling buffer of `Float32Array(50)` columns (up to 280 columns ≈ 140 s of history). A monotonic `spectrumSampleCount` counter enables the same read-index pattern used by the other display buffers.

The hi-res low-frequency spectrogram uses a separate 2560-sample (10 s) per-channel rolling buffer and its own set of 76 Hann-weighted DFT twiddle factors (0.5–8.0 Hz at 0.1 Hz steps). It stores `Float32Array(76)` columns in `_specLoDisplay` with its own `spectrumLoSampleCount` counter. The same artifact rejection and quality-weighted averaging apply. ~1.2 MB of precomputed kernels (76 bins × 2560 samples × 2 components × 4 bytes).

### Stage 5 — Heatmap rendering (BioDataDisplay)

The two panels use separate data buffers and plain 2D `<canvas>` (not WebGL) with a column-shift approach since the update rate is low (~2 Hz):

1. **Auto-scale:** Running min/max of log₁₀ power expand immediately on new extremes and contract slowly (decay 0.995 per column), with a minimum dynamic range of 2 decades. Each panel maintains its own scale to optimise contrast for its frequency range.
2. **Shift left:** `ctx.drawImage(canvas, -2, 0)` scrolls the existing content two pixels left (column width = 2 px).
3. **Draw column:** A 2×H `ImageData` is filled using the viridis colormap LUT (256 entries, piecewise-linear from 9 key stops). Frequency axis labels are HTML elements alongside each canvas.

**Full spectrogram** (`#spec-canvas`, 280×86 native px): bins 8–50 Hz (43 bins), 2 px/bin vertically, 2 px/column horizontally. Uses `_specDisplay` (256-sample DFT, 1 Hz resolution). Axis labels: 50, 8 Hz.

**Delta/theta zoom** (`#spec-lo-canvas`, 280×76 native px): 0.5–8.0 Hz at 0.1 Hz resolution (76 bins), 1 px/bin vertically, 2 px/column horizontally. Uses a dedicated `_specLoDisplay` buffer computed from a 2560-sample (10 s) Hann-windowed DFT with precomputed twiddle factors for 76 fractional-Hz bins. First column appears after 10 s of data accumulation. Separate auto-scaling to maximise contrast for sub-Hz beat entrainment dynamics. Axis labels: 8, 4, 0.5 Hz.

The `image-rendering: pixelated` CSS property ensures bins render with sharp edges when CSS-scaled.

### Viridis colormap

The colormap is a 256-entry RGB lookup table precomputed at module load from 9 piecewise-linear stops approximating matplotlib's viridis:

| Normalized value | Color |
|-----------------|-------|
| 0.0 | dark purple (68, 1, 84) |
| 0.25 | blue (59, 82, 139) |
| 0.5 | teal (33, 145, 140) |
| 0.75 | green (122, 209, 81) |
| 1.0 | yellow (253, 231, 37) |

Low power → purple/blue, high power → green/yellow.

### Future: Multitaper spectral estimation

The current implementation uses a single Hann window, which provides ~-31 dB sidelobe suppression — adequate for a visualization panel. For lower-variance estimates suitable for research-grade analysis, a **multitaper** approach using Discrete Prolate Spheroidal Sequences (DPSS / Slepian tapers) could replace the Hann window:

1. **Pre-generate DPSS tapers** in Python using `scipy.signal.windows.dpss(N=256, NW=3)` and export as a JSON array (JavaScript lacks a native DPSS generator).
2. **Compute K individual spectra** by multiplying the signal by each of the `K = 2·NW - 1 = 5` tapers, then taking the DFT of each.
3. **Average the K power spectra** to produce the final multitaper estimate.

The rendering pipeline (Stages 4–5) would remain unchanged — only the spectral estimation (Stages 1–2) would be swapped. The main tradeoff is shipping a ~30 KB JSON taper file and `K×` more DFT computation per window (5× at NW=3), which is still negligible at the 2 Hz update rate.
